## React-FoodrecipeGraphQlHasura

In the project, Hasura tool is used to implement graphql and database that serves as backend while React is used for front end development. The application allows user to search for food recipe by entering few letters of the given meal. Clicking on the meal will take you to next page where user can review it/ provide comment.

### Learning Outcome

- React Router : Allows to build single page application with navigation without the page refreshing as the user navigates

- GraphQL : It's a query language for api and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data

#### Apolo Client react hooks

- useSubscription : Similar to queries but it allows to fetch data in real time. for example: creation of object, updated field
- useMutation : Modify the data or updates the field in server
